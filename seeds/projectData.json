The framework starts by desiging a model, a design if you will, of what the user will work with when they use the app. This is followed by the view. The view is built using handlebars or another templating function, that will dynamically generate page data given the model that it fits. Finally, this brings us to Controller, which simply routes the user to the appropriate page.",
